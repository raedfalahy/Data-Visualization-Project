Cancer Incidence Visualization

This project is a data visualization tool that leverages Python, Pandas, and Plotly to provide an interactive way to explore cancer incidence data from the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) dataset.

Requirements

To run this project, you will need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your computer. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Additionally, you'll need to install the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
plotly
warnings

You can install these libraries using pip, the package installer for Python:


pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly warnings

Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the following command:



git clone https://github.com/your-username/ADV-project.git
Replace "your-username" and "your-repository-name" with your GitHub username and repository name, respectively.

Download the OECD_CANCER.csv dataset from the OECD website: https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=HEALTH_STAT

Place the downloaded file in the same directory as the cloned repository.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the cloned repository and the downloaded dataset.

Run the Python script containing the code:



python cancer_visualization.py
Replace "cancer_visualization.py" with the name of the Python script containing the code.

The script will generate several plots using Plotly, which will be displayed in your default web browser.

Note

This README assumes that you have a basic understanding of Python and how to run Python scripts. If you need help setting up your Python environment or running the code, please refer to the Python documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/
